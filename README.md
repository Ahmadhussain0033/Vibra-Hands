# Vibra Hands

## Overview

Vibra Hands is an innovative gesture-based musical interface that allows users to create and manipulate sound using intuitive hand movements and gestures. This glove-based system enables expressive musical performance without the need for traditional instruments, making it ideal for musicians, producers, and experimental artists.

## Features

- **Hand Movement Control** – Move your hands freely to adjust parameters like volume, pitch, and modulation.
- **Gesture-Based Notes** – Specific hand gestures trigger musical notes or chords.
- **Surface Interaction** – Tapping different surfaces influences sound dynamics, such as drum intensity or reverb.
- **Combined Gestures** – Unique gesture combinations unlock advanced sound modulation.
- **Instrument Switching** – Clapping changes between different instruments on the fly.
- **Custom Instrument Controls** – Each instrument type has its own specialized gestures:
  - **Drums:** Taps determine intensity, gestures adjust drum type and sound properties.
  - **Flute:** Hand height controls breath intensity, gestures control hole positions for note selection.

## Implementation Plan

### **Hardware**

- Smart gloves equipped with:
  - IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors for motion tracking.
  - Pressure sensors for surface interaction.
  - Capacitive or flex sensors for detecting finger positions.
  - Haptic feedback for real-time response.

### **Software**

- **Machine Learning Gesture Recognition**
  - Train an AI model to recognize hand movements and gestures.
- **Sound Synthesis Engine**
  - Map gestures to real-time MIDI signals and digital sound processing.
- **Bluetooth/Wireless Connectivity**
  - Enable seamless connection to computers or mobile devices.
- **Customizable Sound Mapping**
  - Allow users to assign gestures to different sounds and effects.

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-User Collaboration** – Jam with other Vibra Hands users in real time.
- **AI-Assisted Performance** – Smart musical accompaniment based on user gestures.
- Add a mike and other stuff so you can control the volume of mike, pitch, reverb and others with hands and use hands to use voice changer effects and AI voices
- add type of shoes to this as well tho idk how that will work
