# Vibra Hands

## Overview

Vibra Hands is an innovative gesture-based musical interface that allows users to create and manipulate sound using intuitive hand movements and gestures. This glove-based system enables expressive musical performance without the need for traditional instruments, making it ideal for musicians, producers, and experimental artists.

## Features

- **Hand Movement Control** ‚Äì Move your hands freely to adjust parameters like volume, pitch, and modulation.
- **Gesture-Based Notes** ‚Äì Specific hand gestures trigger musical notes or chords.
- **Surface Interaction** ‚Äì Tapping different surfaces influences sound dynamics, such as drum intensity or reverb.
- **Combined Gestures** ‚Äì Unique gesture combinations unlock advanced sound modulation.
- **Instrument Switching** ‚Äì Clapping changes between different instruments on the fly.
- **Custom Instrument Controls** ‚Äì Each instrument type has its own specialized gestures:
  - **Drums:** Taps determine intensity, gestures adjust drum type and sound properties.
  - **Flute:** Hand height controls breath intensity, gestures control hole positions for note selection.

## üìå Summary of What This Setup Can Detect  
‚úÖ **Hand Motion (IMU):** Tracks movement, speed, and tilt.  
‚úÖ **Soft & Hard Presses (FSR):** Detects how much force is applied.  
‚úÖ **Rapid Hits & Vibrations (Piezo Sensor):** Measures impact intensity.  
‚úÖ **Haptic Feedback:** Provides vibration response.  
‚úÖ **Wireless Control:** Sends real-time data over Bluetooth/WiFi.

## **Software**

- **Machine Learning Gesture Recognition**
  - Train an AI model to recognize hand movements and gestures.
- **Sound Synthesis Engine**
  - Map gestures to real-time MIDI signals and digital sound processing.
- **Bluetooth/Wireless Connectivity**
  - Enable seamless connection to computers or mobile devices.
- **Customizable Sound Mapping**
  - Allow users to assign gestures to different sounds and effects.

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-User Collaboration** ‚Äì Jam with other Vibra Hands users in real time.
- **AI-Assisted Performance** ‚Äì Smart musical accompaniment based on user gestures.
- Add a mike and other stuff so you can control the volume of mike, pitch, reverb and others with hands and use hands to use voice changer effects and AI voices
- add type of shoes to this as well tho idk how that will work
